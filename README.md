#The first W4RA project for farmers in Burkina Faso as Hello World.

Ney Yibeogo or Hello World in Moore language is an application that we are developing for the innovative farners in the Zondoma and Yatenga regions on the cnetral Plateau of Burkoina Faso. This project started in 2016 with Andr√© Baart, Francis Dittoh, and other W4RA team members. The project is about weather forecasts based on indigenous knowledge.
